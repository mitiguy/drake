    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows you how to set up simulations with hydroelastic contacts. It also shows you how to report contact results numerically and visualize them in MeshCat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally this contact model was invented by Ryan Elandt as *Pressure Field Contact*. In Drake, we call our implmentation *Hydroelastic Contact*. The abstract of [Ryan Elandt's dissertation](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/112919) says:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"*...This model is useful in situations where deformation in the contact region is qualitatively important, but need not be accurate. PFC is a model of, and not a convergent approximation of, continuum mechanics. In PFC, each of the two contacting objects is assigned an immutable internal virtual pressure' field. ... the PFC contact surface is defined as the set of points where the two pressure fields are equal. ...*\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Hydroelastic contact is faster than Finite Element model but less accurate. Hydroelastic contact is slower than point contact (used in most simulators including Drake as the default) but exhibits more stable behavior in challenging situations involving rolling friction, energy dissipation, and non-convex geometries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, this tutorial shows contacts between a rigid hydroelastic geometry and a compliant hydroelastic geometry. Both of them are rigid in the sense of rigid body dynamics. They do not have mechanical deformation. In our implementation, a compliant hydroelastic geometry has a pressure field representation (on a tetrahedral mesh, for example), but a rigid hydroelastic geometry only has a boundary surface representation (a triangle surface mesh, for example). Their contact patch always lies on the surface of the rigid hydroelastic geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have another tutorial to show contacts between two compliant hydroelastic geometries. Their contact patch will be the surface of points where their pressure fields are equal.\n",
